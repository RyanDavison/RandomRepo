# RandomRepo
Open a random Github repository using either the Python script or the html bookmarklet (in the JAVASCRIPT directory). You can see an example of the bookmarklet and add it to your browser by visiting this  [Random Repo page](https://ryandavison.github.io/RandomRepo/JAVASCRIPT/random_src.html) and dragging the link to your bookmarks bar.

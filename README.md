# RandomRepo
Open a random Github repository using either the Python script or the html bookmarklet (in the JAVASCRIPT directory). You
can add the bookmarklet by going to this [Random Repo page](https://ryandavison.github.io/RandomRepo/JAVASCRIPT/random_src.html) and dragging the link to 
your bookmarks bar.
